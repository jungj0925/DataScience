				<h1>What is Data Science?</h1>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>First introduced in the 1980s, data science is one 
				of the most demanding and desired career paths today. 
				Data science is extracting insights 
				and meaningful information from large 
				volumes of data collected by various 
				organizations and using it to predict trends. 
				It is used to understand and analyze real life 
				situations using data and applies analytics and machine 
				learning to further optimize the user’s experience and 
				their business outcomes (ibm.com). </p>
				<img src="datascience.gif">
				<h2>Why is it Important?</h2>
				<p>Data volumes have increased substantially 
				due to the development of technology in the past 
				decade. It's estimated that 90 percent of the data in 
				the world was created in the last two years, and over 10 million
				photos are uploaded to Facebook every hour (oracle.com). According 
				to the IDC, global data will grow to 175 zettabytes by 2025, which 
				is about 1 sextillion bytes, or 1 billion Terabytes (jigsawacademy.com). These 
				large chunks of data, also called the Big Data, is crucial 
				for technological development today. Data science is thought 
				to be the bedrock of modern day innovation, where they rely on
				Machine Learning (ML) to analyze the data, rather than using business
				analysts for a better understanding of the dataset. Using computer science,
				ML, statistics, and system analytics, Data Science is used for simple daily
				technologies like Siri, Alexa, or Tesla’s self-driving AI, to more complex 
				topics such as Facebook's advertising algorithms or YouTube's suggested videos
				algorithms.  </p>

				<h1>Achievements & Emerging Technology</h1>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>1. Self-Driving (Autonomous) Capabilities</h2>
				<p>Self driving cars have been a hot topic amongst both tech lovers 
				and car enthusiasts with a lot of startups and companies jumping into
				this field. Google started off the self-driving projects back in 2009
				which could navigate through California's busy streets without human
				interface. By using ML, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and databases 
				collected by several companies, we could train the autonomous cars
				and teach them, using algorithms, what real-life driving looks like. </p>
				<div class="split">
					<img src="tesla.gif"/> 
					<p>The GIF on the left is what Tesla sees when it is self-driving.
					The algorithms identify various elements of the surrounding environment
					, including cars, road lanes, road signs, and data of the car. In
					order for a machine to "see", they need to follow the 2 steps needed: 
					image classifications and image localization. Image classification 
					classifies what the machine is looking at, and image localization is 
					finding where the image is located. Using Convolutional Neural Network
					(CNN), the machine learns and identifies the object using the databases
					collected. The CNN basically scans the image, and whenever it detects 
					something that's known, it returns "True", and otherwise, "False".</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					The autonomous technology is fast-growing, with competitors like Tesla and GM developing the technology for the best self-driving cars. 
				</p>
				<h2>2. Data Science for Stock Market</h2>
				<div class="split">
					<p>With many individuals jumping into stocks/cryptos, data science has greatly contributed in predicting and analyzing trends of the stock market. The first time Big Data was used for the stock market was when a company named RS Metrics started to create algorithms that looked at various different oil tanks, and could figure out how much oil is left based on the shadows. They could then predict what the oil market would look like before the report has been made about it, and manipulate the market based on the data they collected.</p>

				</div>
				<p>
					Also, high frequency trading algorithms analyze social media sites to foresee what the market will look like. Although algorithms and data science using databases can’t predict the outlook of the market with a 100% accuracy, it can be used in such ways where an individual can profit from the information collected (mygreatlearning.com).

				<h1>Ethical Issues</h1>
			</div>
				<p>There’s no doubt about machine learning and artificial intelligence leading and developing the world in the near future. As data science is all about machine learning, it has troubles knowing what’s ethically right or wrong. One example of unethical data science is using Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (COMPAS) used by the U.S courts, they were able to evaluate the risk level of a defendant. According to to Maximilian Hofer, a Machine Learning consultor at Sigma Squared, 3 main ethical issues of data science can be unfair discrimination, reinforcing human biases and lack of transparency. </p>
				<h2>1. Unfair Discrimination</h2>
				<p>The data often reflects on unfair social biases on racial discrimination, the Artificial Intelligence learned from the data will also be discriminatingthe race as it reflects on the data given. ProPublica, a news organization, has showed unfair discrimination by analysing over 10,000 defendant samples from the Broward County Sheriff’s Office in Florida (towardsdatascience.com). </p>
				<h2>2. Reinforcing Human Biases</h2>
				<p>Data science has limitations making decisions based on previous data, as there could be discrimination against people of a particular race. If the data fed to COMPAS was perfectly unbiased, the discrimination wouldn’t occur. By predicting a certain defendant/race to be high risk, it is obvious that the data being fed is biased against a certain group of people, which is not ethical at all. </p>
				<h2>3. Lack of Transparency</h2>
				<p>Despite the fact that the COMPAS had issues regarding discrimination, the step-by-step process of the workings of COMPAS has not been revealed to the public. Exact function and the processing of the model can be unclear.	</p>
				<h2>More Ethical Issues</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Privacy Issues - methods for handling sensitive data</li>
					<li>Hazards from learning inaccurate or highly biased data from the open internet</li>
				</ul>
